// Ideally these would be automated tests with a mocked server.
// Potential libraries to use:
//  - Specflow (https://github.com/techtalk/SpecFlow); To write human-readable acceptance tests.
//  - Moq (https://github.com/moq/moq4); To easily mock functions. (mainly to fake the client part, because connecting to the real Everybody Edits Universe™ servers is a bad idea...)

// For now it's being manually tested...
